# Collaborative CNN Development Project

This project focuses on building and comparing convolutional neural network (CNN) models for the same image classification task using different datasets. **Anmol** and **Balveer Singh** worked independently on their own datasets, trained separate models, and then tested each other’s models to study generalization and domain shift. All collaboration is done through GitHub using forks, branches, pull requests, and issues, without sharing any raw data.
