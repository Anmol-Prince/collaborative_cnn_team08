# Collaborative CNN Project – Team 08

This repository contains the work done for the **Research Methodology** course assignment.  
The goal of the project was to learn **collaborative research workflow, GitHub teamwork, and model comparison** by independently training CNN models on different datasets and evaluating them across domains.

This project is **purely for learning and academic purposes**, focusing on:
- Practicing GitHub collaboration  
- Understanding dataset domain shift  
- Sharing models without sharing datasets  
- Documenting experiments and results

## 📌 Project Overview

Both team members trained their own **custom CNN models** for the *Cats vs Dogs* classification task using **different datasets**.  
Each member:

1. Collected or prepared their own training/testing dataset  
2. Trained a CNN model (`model_v1` or `model_v2`)  
3. Saved model weights and metrics  
4. Evaluated the model on the other teammate’s dataset  
5. Analyzed generalization and domain shift  

This repo includes:
- Model architectures (`models/`)
- Training and testing notebooks (`notebooks/`)
- Evaluation results (`results/`)
- Utility functions (`utils/`)
- Final project report (`report.md`)

## 📚 Purpose

This repository is part of the **Research Methodology** assignment and is intended **only for educational purposes**.  
It helped us learn:

- Collaborative GitHub workflows  
- Reproducible ML experiment design  
- Cross-domain model evaluation  
- Writing structured research reports

## ⚠️ Note on Datasets

Datasets are **not included** in this repository due to size and licensing.  
Each user worked on their own dataset locally.
